# Questions DAWG can help answer

## What workgroups am I a member of?
For Data Access Workgroups: go [here](https://groups.google.com/my-groups) and
search for "da-wg". You can paste the resulting Google Groups into DAWG to get
more info about them.

For GCPv2 workgroups: search DAWG for your email address. For any workgroups
you find your email in, you can search for those workgroups in DAWG to see what
other access you have as a result of being in those workgroups. For instance,
if you search for your email address and find your email under
`workgroup:dataplatform/developers`, you can search for
`workgroup:dataplatform/developers` to see what other groups workgroups that
workgroup is associated with.

# Who is in charge of this workgroup?
Search for the workgroup name in DAWG. The Sponsor and Managers are owners of
the workgroup and should be able to answer questions about it.

# What is this workgroup used for?
Search for the workgroup name in DAG. Follow the links provided to get
background information on the formation and purpose of the workgroup. If there
are no links, there's a good chance the workgroup is deprecated.

# More specifically: what resources is this workgroup configured to have access to?
Currently: click the bottom link when searching for a workgroup. We're planning
to update DAWG to make support search subgroups as well. Note: you will need
Github access to run this code search. You may not have access to all private
repositories to see configuration that uses your workgroup.

# How do I join this workgroup?
Usually the first link under `links` for a workgroup will be a link to
documentation on how to join. If it isn't, you can ask the group manager if one
is listed to add you. If the group is in GCPv2 and you have access to and are comfortable filing
a PR to update a YAML doc, you can go
[here](https://github.com/mozilla-it/global-platform-admin/tree/main/google-workspace-management/tf/workgroups),
search for your workgroup, and propose a change adding yourself.

# Is this workgroup abandoned/deprecated?
If the Sponsor is "None" for a workgroup, that is a pretty good sign the
workgroup is deprecated. If you follow the github search link and don't see any
results, that's also a pretty good sign the workgroup is not actively used. 
[Consult DSRE](https://mozilla-hub.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SRE/pages/27921246/Contacting+Data+SRE)
if you think you should be a member of a workgroup that doesn't have a Sponsor.
